If you want to learn more about the datasets our STRATOS publications (insert link) use, you've come to the right place! STRATOS wants to guide data scientists to use best practise methods in data analysis, sometimes showcasing these methods on practical data examples.
<br>
Every STRATOS publication that analyzes a dataset is listed here, together with the information if it is publicly available, and, if yes, a download link or instructions.
