# Welcome!
If you want to learn more about the datasets our <a href="https://www.stratos-initiative.org/en/publications" target="_blank">STRATOS publications</a> use, you've come to the right place! STRATOS wants to guide data scientists to use best practise methods in data analysis, sometimes showcasing these methods on practical data examples.
<br>
Every STRATOS publication that analyzes a dataset is listed here, together with the information if it is publicly available, and, if yes, a download link or instructions.
